> Boring Quest is task managment app with a game theme. In our modern day society people invest most of their time into non-productive activities such as gaming instead of completing their tasks. We can conclude that people are motivated to invest their time in activities that offer a fun reward system.
> The reward system in Boring Quest is simple:
   - You complete tasks and earn points.
   - You fail tasks and lose points.
> Some additional features in Boring Quest are:
   - Productivity tracking
   - Being able to create guilds and assign tasks to other users
   
### User Stories
- As a user, I want to make tasks more fun, so that I can be more motivated to finish them
- As a user, I want to automate reoccuring tasks, so that I can save time
- As a user, I want to visualize my productivity times, so that I can find the best time to start a task
- As a user, I want to be able to add friends, so that I can assign them tasks

> This design was planned before on paper, then moved to Figma app for the fine details.
Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
