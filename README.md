> Boring Quest is task managment app with a game theme. In our modern day society people invest most of their time into non-productive activities such as gaming instead of completing their tasks. We can conclude that people are motivated to invest their time in activities that offer a fun reward system.
> The reward system in Boring Quest is simple:
   - You complete tasks and earn points.
   - You fail tasks and lose points.
> Some additional features in Boring Quest are:
   - Productivity tracking
   - Being able to create guilds and assign tasks to other users

Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [React Native app development framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React native is used for building native apps using React. It can be used to develop applications that target anything from Android, iOS devices to Windows systems.
- For storage (database), the app uses the Mongodb(https://www.mongodb.com/) package which allows for fast and easy access to data.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses [expo-notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications) package which supports Android, iOS.
- The app uses a simple and fun design aimed to give the user an easy to use app while maintaing a game theme.
